                To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions.<br>
                It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable.<br>
                These are the tales of those times.<br>

                <li>Forget the power of technology and science, <i>for so much has been forgotten</i>, never to be re-learned.</li>
                <li>Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future <b>there is only war</b>.</li>
                <li>There is <u>no peace</u> amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.</li>
